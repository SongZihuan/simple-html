# Simple Welcome Page (SIMPLE-HTML)

This is a simple welcome page. I used static HTML+CSS+JS to code it.

The `index.new.html` page can be used as your default website page.

The error code page is in the error folder.

Note: The `.signal.html` file is a file after the inline style. It can be used as a separate page.

Note: `.songzihuan.signal.html` is the `signal.html file` file with the author's personal style added.
